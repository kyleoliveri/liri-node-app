# liri-node-app

- Liri is a CLI Node application that takes in user search parameters and displays the data that you requested. There are four commands to pick from:

    - concert-this
        - When you run the following command: node liri.js concert-this (insert band name here), Liri will use the Bands in Town API to retrieve the data.

    - spotify-this-song
        - When you run the following command: node liri.js spotify-this-song (insert song name), Liri will use the Spotify API to retrieve all songs with the relevant title in their database.

    - movie-this
        - When you run the following command: node liri.js movie-this (insert movie title), Liri will use the OMDB API to pull back all of the data regarding that movie.

    - do-what-it-says
        - When you run the following command: node liri.js do-what-it-says, Liri was read all of the text in the random.txt file and perform the command listed.
